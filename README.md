Hello All reading this!

My name is CreamElDudJafar. I am pleased to announced these are the new updated IPS Files for Crystal Kaizo, Blue Kaizo and Intense Indigo. 

The update is the latest as of 02/05/2025

Blue Kaizo’s Last Major Update was 2016
Crystal Kaizo’s Last Major Update was 2016
Intense Indigo’s Last Major Update was 2016

These games were originally developed by the legendary SinisterHoodedFigure. These games are also the reason I started to get into hacks myself.

I reached out to SinisterHoodedFigure about updating these games. He agreed and allowed this process. He also agreed to have my release the patches for all of you to play AS LONG AS THE UPDATE IS CREDITED TO SINISTERHOODEDFIGURE (HIS GAMES NOT MINE). I just assisted along the way!

Here is some information about the new updates.

Intense Indigo: Game is in Full Color- Original still exists too. You have the option to play it with Gen 1 graphics in full color or Gen 2 graphics in full color. The Gen 2 graphics have the caught indicator and exp bar as well. Gym Leaders and Elite 4 have perfect DVs for their pokemon, and HMs are deletable.

Crystal Kaizo: Crystal Kaizo now has it when you use a repel and it wears off it will ask to use another. HMs are deletable, All stones to evolve eevee now say Able (Umbreon and Espeon Sun/Moon stones in the past would say Unable but would still evolve), Rare Candies in Indigo Plateau Mart for 1 dollar, Game Name now displays in Hall of Fame movie credit screen.

Blue Kaizo: Game is in Full Color- Original still exists too. You have the option to play it with Gen 1 graphics in full color or Gen 2 graphics in full color. The Gen 2 graphics have the caught indicator and exp bar as well. Gym Leaders and Elite 4 have perfect DVs for their pokemon, and HMs are deletable. The Game Name now displays in Hall of Fame movie credit screen. Route 12 had a slight map change in one spot. THE BIGGEST BLUE KAIZO CHANGE IS ELITE 4 AND CHAMPION AI STYLE AND POKEMON PARTIES WERE UPDATED BY SINISTERHOODEDFIGURE.

These games were all tested numerous times, however, bugs do happen in games AND BUGS ARE FOUND based on other plays playstyle. SO If any bugs or issues are found, please reach out to SinisterHoodedFigure or myself!

Hello All reading this!

My name is CreamElDudJafar. I am pleased to announced these are the new updated IPS Files for Crystal Kaizo, Blue Kaizo, Emerald Kaizo and Intense Indigo. 

The update is the latest as of 03/12/2025

Blue Kaizo’s Last Major Update was 2016
Crystal Kaizo’s Last Major Update was 2016
Intense Indigo’s Last Major Update was 2016

These games were originally developed by the legendary SinisterHoodedFigure. These games are also the reason I started to get into hacks myself.

I reached out to SinisterHoodedFigure about updating these games. He agreed and allowed this process. He also agreed to have my release the patches for all of you to play AS LONG AS THE UPDATE IS CREDITED TO SINISTERHOODEDFIGURE (HIS GAMES NOT MINE). I just assisted along the way!

Here is some information about the new updates.

Emerald Kaizo: New Title Screen with game name.

Intense Indigo: Game is in Full Color- Original graphics still exists too. You have the option to play it with Gen 1 graphics in full color or Gen 2 graphics in full color. The Gen 2 graphics have the caught indicator and exp bar as well. HMs are deletable.

Crystal Kaizo: Crystal Kaizo now has it when you use a repel and it wears off it will ask to use another. HMs are deletable, All stones to evolve eevee now say Able (Umbreon and Espeon Sun/Moon stones in the past would say Unable but would still evolve), Rare Candies in Indigo Plateau Mart for 1 dollar, Game Name now displays in Hall of Fame movie credit screen.

Blue Kaizo: Game is in Full Color- Original graphics still exists too. You have the option to play it with Gen 1 graphics in full color or Gen 2 graphics in full color. The Gen 2 graphics have the caught indicator and exp bar as well. HMs are deletable. When Repels are done they will ask you if you want to use another. The Game Name now displays in Hall of Fame movie credit screen. Route 12 had a slight map change in one spot. 50 BAG SPACE. FINALLY, THE BIGGEST BLUE KAIZO CHANGE IS ELITE 4 AND CHAMPION AI STYLE AND POKEMON PARTIES WERE UPDATED BY SINISTERHOODEDFIGURE.

*Note FOR BLUE KAIZO 50 BAG SPACE: This will alter save compatibility. All current items will be removed from bag or replaced by glitch items. If you want to keep your current save file, I suggest putting your important items in the PC first. Once you purchase a new item the bag space glitch items will disappear.

Also using a save editor like PKHEX will not work if you try to add items to your bag. If you must use a save editor. You can add items to your PC and withdraw them and put them in your bag that way.

I have tried it for the sake of this tutorial but use at your own risk!*

These games were all tested numerous times, however, bugs do happen in games AND BUGS ARE FOUND based on other plays playstyle. SO If any bugs or issues are found, please reach out to SinisterHoodedFigure or myself!

PATCH BLUE KAIZO AND INTENSE INDIGO TO POKEMON BLUE. PATCH CRYSTAL KAIZO TO POKEMON CRYSTAL. PATCH EMERALD KAIZO TO POKEMON EMERALD.
